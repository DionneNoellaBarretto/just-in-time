# Project 3: Interactive Full-MERN-Stack Application
This repository is for group 2's Project3 - Interactive Performant and Scalable Full-MERN-Stack single-page Application: 'Just In Time'. The main purpose of this project to build a full MERN stack single-page application, combined with a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform -all from scratch. This app will execute a design that solves a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

## Just In Time Motivation:
 We all have experienced the panic scramble when a loved one is in need of medical attention be it via emergency response services or a guardian or caretaker and we are frantically searching for medicines, allergies, PCP information etc.
 👉  To stay calm and composed in such situations and supply the requested information in few clicks  was the motivation behind ***"just-in-time"***  an app that helps you organize all medical emergency information in a single page!


## User Story

***AS*** an **admin** (for example: authorized parent or guardian) <br/>
***I WANT*** to create a **profile** for my loved one to display all their medical emergency information  </br>
***SO AS*** to allow **care givers/nannies/guardians/others** authorized to view this information to leverage it in time of need should an emergency manifest itself!

## Project Requirements

Apply everything we’ve learnt over the past six months to create a real-world full-mern-stack application that we'll showcase to potential employers. Besides the user story and acceptance criteria our project fulfils the following requirements:
```
✔️ Use React for the front end.
✔️ Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
✔️ Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
✔️ Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
✔️ Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
✔️ Have a polished UI.
✔️ Be responsive.
✔️ Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
✔️ Include authentication (JWT).
✔️ Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
✔️ Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
✔️ Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
